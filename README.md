# PlotlyExamples

Assuming the package is installed, just pass a simple data array to the function plotlyData. If timestamps are not passed to the function, they will be generated based on the number of samples. The plot should open in a new web browser. Just a heads up, you should only pull one plot at a time using Plotly.
